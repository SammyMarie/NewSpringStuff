This project was developed using gradle as the dependency management.
The Tomcat server was included in the gradle thus there's no need to have tomcat installed in your system though this means some performance lag
due to waiting for the server to startup.
Import the project to your IDE as a gradle project to view the code, gradle comes with all the version requirements.

*Note:
There is a need to check the version of JDK in your IDE as the project uses 1.8. 

To run the project in your git bash: 
1. Navigate to the project folder then, 
2. Run the command "./gradlew clean tomcatRunWar" or in your windows commandline run 
"gradlew clean tomcatRunWar" which will automatically startup the application.

Technologies used:
1. Gradle for build and dependency management.
2. SonarQube for code quality review.
3. Spring MVC.
4. JDK 1.8.
5. Tomcat application container.

* For SonarQube to run on your PC if you don't already have that, please follow the instructions on any of these two links to both install and run it
